# Spatial Variations UK House Prices


This study seeks to glean insights from house price data collected by the land registry in 2016 and the most recent census data (“2011 Census data - Office for National Statistics”). The spatial relationship between house prices and various census variables, such as home ownership will be investigated. Additionally, spatial variations of house prices throughout the UK will be studied, with a focus on comparing the city of London with the rest of the country.

This paper seeks to ask:
•	What socio economic variables are correlated with House prices? 
•	How does this correlation vary spatially? 
•	What type of people live in areas with higher house prices? 
•	Can spatial data inform a young adults decision on where best to live/work and buy a house?
